			<h1>Structural Analysis</h1>

			<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
			<p>The first sentence of the opening paragraph <a href="article.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>, highlighted in the following quote, would be the thesis statement of this article based on two reasons. Firstly, it contains the main idea of the whole essay that willpower affects choices for the diet. Secondly, it brings up the contrasting concept of present pleasure and future benefits, two factors that will influence decision-making in the brain.</p>
			<p class="quote"><q><span style="background-color:#80cdc1;">Sticking to a diet requires self-control and a willingness to forgo present pleasures for future benefits.</span> Not surprisingly, almost everyone yields to temptation at least sometimes, opting for the cookie instead of the apple. Wondering why we so often override our resolve, scientists at the Laboratory for Social and Neural Systems Research at the University of Zurich recently considered the role of stress, which is linked to a variety of health problems, including weight gain. (There’s something to the rom-com cliché of the jilted lover eating ice cream directly from the carton.) But just how stress might drive us to sweets has not been altogether clear. It turns out that even mild stress may immediately alter the workings of our brains in ways that undermine willpower.</q></p>

		<h2>Essay Outline</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b><a href="article.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a> - Experiment of how stress will affect subjects’ choices</b><br/> 
			In this section, the author uses the experiment of stress and choice to strengthen the statement that even mild stress may alter the workings of human brains as a strategy.</li>

			<li><b><a href="article.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a> - The result of the experiment shows that stress will undermine the ability of self-control</b><br/>
			The comparing results of the experiment prove that stress will affect parts of the brain, amplifying the temptation of enjoying tasty foods and undermining long-range planning.</li>
		 	<li><b><a href="article.html#sec4">[Sec. #4]</a>- Escape from the reasonable but unhealthy neurological responses</b><br/> 
			These two paragraphs reveal the responses of reaching comfort instead of focusing on the future when confronting stressful situations make sense. However, those responses could be avoided. </li>

			<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
			<p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author quotes Todd Hare’s statement, the lead author of the study of stress, to imply that humans could escape the instinctive reaction caused by stress. Just as the statement pointed out at the very first beginning, <span style="background-color:#80cdc1;">a person needs to control himself to make better decisions considering his future</span>.</p>
			<p class="quote"><q>It doesn’t have to be this way. When faced with stress, just ”think about an action path that improves your choice,’’ says Todd Hare, lead author of the study. Go for a walk instead of eating. “If you know you will have a hard time resisting,’’ he adds, “don’t store snacks at home.</q></p>
