					Music Therapy
				</h1>
				<p>
					Music is quite common in people’s daily lives. People usually listen to it naturally and play it delightfully, but barely notice the very fact that music could influence nearly the entire human brain’s working system. However, music affects humans mentally and physically. Externally, music could give people goosebumps, stimulation of tearing, or desire to dance, etc. Internally, music could affect emotion, hormones, heart rate, etc.  Music implicates and touches on so many aspects of human lives. It helps people to concentrate, helps motivate them to do their best, and helps them relax. In short, music plays an important role whether in human brains or lives. The capability of music covers a large part of cognition. In addition to only appreciating and playing music, it can also be used to stimulate the reactions of brain systems. What’s more, rather than being separated into a right hemisphere and a left hemisphere,researches represent the relationship that music and language both depend on some of the same brain systems then process together.

					When using brains, humans could hardly separate the working system in the brain into some specific areas. Every action that humans make usually demands several brain regions to execute. For instance, when having a conversation with others, a person would not only use ears to hear, brain to think, and mouth to respond. His responses also need eyes to observe others’ body language, analyze their tone and word choices, or discover the implied message of the dialogue. The process may acquire the auditory cortex, visual cortex, prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, limbic system, Broca’s area, Wernicke’s area, angular gyrus, and much more related areas to operate. Let alone the complete procedures that music and language process in the brain. Studies have found that both music and language depend on the same two memory systems in the brain. One is in the temporal lobes that help humans memorize information; the other is in the frontal lobes that help humans unconsciously learn and use the rules of music and language. As a result, using music therapy could help those who have trouble speaking and memorizing.

					Apart from traditional speech therapy, music therapy that focuses on neurologic function could improve speaking, cognitive, sensory, and motor functions. A music therapist would lead the patient to sing with him. He may create some lyrics and melodies to aid the patient to speak out his name, basic greetings, and so on even without music. The mechanism of this kind of music therapy is by stimulating the speaking pathway in the left cerebral hemisphere that controls the language part more through the singing pathway in the right cerebral hemisphere that controls the music part more. And the reason is singing can distinguish phonemes that consist of words and phrases for a length of syllables. Through slow singing of connected segments, the speech fluency of aphasic who speak non-fluently could get advanced. While the rhythmic feature such as intonation, tones, and syllable accent could help in speaking; thus, the progression could activate the right cerebral hemisphere, as well. Eventually, all the therapeutic elements help patients recover the best and attain the influence of activating the left cerebral hemisphere indirectly. Impressively, music might not cure the impaired regions completely, but music can assist them to heal at a great level.
