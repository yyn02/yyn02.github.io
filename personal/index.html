			Nice to meet you! My name is Yen-Yun Ting, or you can call me Cailyn. I study Foreign Language and Literature at National Tsing Hua University. My hobbies are reading, listening to music, and designing. Instead of studying textbooks and doing homework, I spend a lot of time playing instruments and making designs in senior high school. Although many people consider that students in Taiwan should only focus on schoolwork, interest is pivotal and would influence oneâ€™s life more. Take music as an example. Playing musical instruments let me cultivate the ability to focus. Then, I build my patience through every practice. Besides, if I want to become a better player, I have to schedule my time to practice more. Here is the opportunity of being responsible for myself. Last, playing well in each performance is nearly impossible. Thus, I have to learn how to regulate my emotion then bounce back in the fastest way. When confronting frustration, I need to force myself to be fortitudinous. All in all, thanks to my interest, I foster the personalities of being patient, responsible, and fortitudinous. With these advantages, I may not have the best grade, but a better attitude.
